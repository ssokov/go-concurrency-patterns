# Go Concurrency Patterns

A structured collection of core Go concurrency patterns focused on channel-based coordination and goroutine orchestration.

This repository demonstrates practical implementations of streaming, fan-in/fan-out composition, worker pools, backpressure control, rate limiting, and channel orchestration patterns.

All patterns are implemented using Go generics.

Each pattern is written in an idiomatic, minimal, and race-safe way.
